<b>Rosamund Green Farm <b> in the South West of England has been established since 1991 with over 150 fences from BE100 to 4/5* levels all of which have proper all weather take offs and landings. The course is built on 20 acres of very well drained land. Many of the fences are feature fences with flags and flowers giving them a competition look with an emphasis on challenging lines as seen on cross country courses here and in Europe.

Our facilities are used and recommended by Olympic, World, European and top international event riders from all corners of the country and frequently used in preparation for major competitions by British and overseas teams.
